# Archived Documentation

This directory contains outdated documentation that no longer reflects the current state of the project.

## Why These Docs Were Archived

These documents were created during early planning phases but were not updated as the project evolved. They contain outdated information that conflicts with the current implementation.

## Archived Documents

### implementation_plan.md
- **Created:** Early development phase
- **Why Archived:** Described a 14-week implementation plan that doesn't match actual development path
- **Status:** Project has progressed beyond this plan; see [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for current plans
- **Reason for Keeping:** Historical reference; shows original thinking

### mvp_scope.md
- **Created:** Early development phase
- **Why Archived:** MVP scope was never fully implemented as described; project took different direction
- **Status:** Current scope better reflected in [CURRENT_STATE.md](../CURRENT_STATE.md)
- **Reason for Keeping:** Historical reference; documents initial vision
