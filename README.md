# react-analyzer

Static code analyzer for React projects.

TODO:

- Map all exported items in a file
- Count how many times each export gets used elsewhere.
- Show any "Dead exports"
- Calculate file directory difference between imports in a file - if something is only imported once by a distant file - maybe it should live closer to that file?
